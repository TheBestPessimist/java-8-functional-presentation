# java 8 stream and functional interfaces

Presented to javaschool students and other test subjects.

This repository resides both on
 [github](https://github.com/TheBestPessimist/java-8-functional-presentation) and on 
 [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/TheBestPessimist/java-8-functional-presentation), 
 and both remotes will be updated at the same time.

Most of the presentation is based on the examples from 
[here](http://winterbe.com/posts/2014/03/16/java-8-tutorial/) 
and [here](http://winterbe.com/posts/2014/07/31/java8-stream-tutorial-examples/) which you really 
really should read and implement as well.

[This](https://blog.jooq.org/2015/08/13/common-sql-clauses-and-their-equivalents-in-java-8-streams/) is something else which you should read!

The presentation should be followed by reading the java classes in `tbp.land.java8.tutorial`
 in the order `J1`, `J2`, `J3`, etc. and by running each method in `run()` in the specific order. 

_Enjoy_ :^^^)
